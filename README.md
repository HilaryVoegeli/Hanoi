# Hanoi
## This project moves disks from column A to column C, using column B, by stacking only smaller disks on top of bigger ones. 

#### To run this project locally download the html file, js file, and css file. To view in your broswer, navigate to the GitHub Page for this project. https://hilaryvoegeli.github.io/Hanoi/
#### In the future I would add an input box so the user could run the program with as many disks as they wanted, and it would be interesting if there was an option for the user to see the moves written out in text, along with the visual demonstration.
